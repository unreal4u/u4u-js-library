convertFormValues
--------------

This function has been deprecated after I realized that the function [.serialize()](http://api.jquery.com/serialize/) 
does exactly the same and is jQuery native. Please ignore this function as it doesn't add any special value or
improvement to the one implemented by jQuery.
