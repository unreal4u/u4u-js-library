u4u-js-library
--------------

u4u-classes is a compilation of JavaScript code written by unreal4u (Camilo Sperberg) available to general public and
usage. Feel free to use and modify anything in these classes you want. They have all 
[BSD licenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses).

Disclaimer
--------------

I'll always will try to maintain basic operation within my classes and ensure that they will do the job they say it does,
but use these classes at your own risk! Most of them have been tested and are already being used in production websites,
but my way of implementing the classes may differ from what you are doing, and in those cases, bugs can originate
without me knowing about them. If you want to use my code, you are free to do so, but it is your responsability to test
them thoroughly to ensure that they will work in your case scenario!
